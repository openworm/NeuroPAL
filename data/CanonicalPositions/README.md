### Canonical positions

[LowResAtlasWithHighResHeadsAndTails.csv](LowResAtlasWithHighResHeadsAndTails.csv): This is a list of whole-worm *C. elegans* neurons positions as assembled and described in the paper ["Toward a More Accurate 3D Atlas of C. elegans Neurons"](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.09.447813v1). It is in XYZ format, e.g. [X,Y,Z], and micron units.

### Canonical NeuroPAL colors

[NeuropalCanonicalColors.csv](NeuropalCanonicalColors.csv): This is a list of colors designated for each neuron in the NeuroPAL line of C. elegans ([NeuroPAL: A Multicolor Atlas for Whole-Brain Neuronal Identification in C. elegans](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2020.12.012)). It is in RGB format, e.g. [R,G,B]. When RGB = [0,0,0] the neuron is panneuronal colored only.
