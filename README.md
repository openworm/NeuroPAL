# NeuroPAL

This repository contains some test scripts which use the NeuroPAL datasets.

# Head and tail datasets

The original publication on NeuroPAL was: Eviatar Yemini, Albert Lin, Amin Nejatbakhsh, Erdem Varol, Ruoxi Sun, Gonzalo E. Mena, Aravinthan D.T. Samuel, Liam Paninski, Vivek Venkatachalam, Oliver Hobert, <b>NeuroPAL: A Multicolor Atlas for Whole-Brain Neuronal Identification in <i>C.Â elegans</i>,
[Cell, Volume 184, Issue 1, 2021](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2020.12.012).

The dataset released with this publication on positions and colors (as used in Figures 2 and 7) of cells in the head and tail has been used in [this Jupyter notebook](TestLoadingData.ipynb), and extracted from the Excel sheet, and converted to NeuroML format.
